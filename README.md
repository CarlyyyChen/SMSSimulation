# SMSSimulation

This is my implementation of the SMS Simulation Exercise:

Message - Represents a single SMS message.  
Producer - Generates a set number of random messages.  
Sender - Simulates sending of SMS messages.  
ProgressMonitor - Monitors and displays the progress of sent and failed messages.  
Main - Entry point to start the simulation.
